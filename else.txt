Problem Statement (Elaborate)
Organizations with large volumes of historical data face challenges in cost-effective storage, efficient retrieval, and compliance-driven retention. Traditional tape-based archives are inflexible and slow to access, while cloud-native solutions can be expensive if not properly tiered. The goal is to modernize archival data management by:
Automating ingestion from legacy/tape sources into a flexible, queryable format (Apache Iceberg).
Using a managed catalog (Polaris) to enable cross-engine access and schema evolution.
Leveraging S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for low-cost, long-term storage.
Implementing tag-driven policies for data lifecycle management, allowing admins to easily mark data for archival or retention.
Ensuring interoperability between analytics engines (e.g., Spark, Snowflake) for future-proofing and flexibility.

The first three images that I've attached basically explain the use case or the problem statement. The fourth  attached image is the template that I need to fill based on the problem statement. Basically the template outlined in the fourth image should describe the solution to the problem discussed in the first images.

Additionally, create design diagrams, suggest different approaches to implement this, elaborately explain the problem statement. 

Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive breakdown based on your images, including an elaborate problem statement, a filled-out template (from image 4), design diagrams, and implementation approaches.
1. Executive Summary
Brief Description:
The initiative aims to implement a managed Apache Iceberg catalog for archival data management, leveraging S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval as the storage layer. The solution will enable efficient, cost-effective, and policy-driven archival of large datasets, supporting cross-engine interoperability (e.g., Spark, Snowflake) and lifecycle management via tagging and schema evolution.
2. Objectives
Primary Objective:
To design and deploy a managed Iceberg catalog (using Polaris Catalog) for archiving historical data, enabling seamless data lifecycle management and cost optimization.
Secondary Objectives:
Enable cross-engine data sharing (BYQE) between Spark, Snowflake, and other engines.
Automate ingestion from tape-restored databases using dynamic, heuristic-based pipelines.
Support tag-driven archival and schema evolution for long-term data retention.
3. Scope
In Scope:
Implementation of Polaris Catalog (managed and open-sourced options).
Integration with S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for storage.
Data ingestion pipelines from tape-restored sources.
Tag-based data lifecycle and archival policies.
Interoperability demonstration between Spark and Snowflake.
Out of Scope:
Nessie Catalog (explicitly scoped out).
Real-time data updates (focus is on historical/archival data).
4. Key Benefits & Value Proposition
Cost Savings: Up to 80% storage cost reduction using S3 Glacier and storage tiering.
Interoperability: Shared open catalog enables cross-engine data access (Spark, Snowflake, Trino, etc.).
Policy-Driven Lifecycle: Tag-based archival and retention policies.
Scalability: Supports large-scale, flexible data formats and schema evolution.
Automation: Heuristic-driven ingestion pipelines reduce manual intervention.

6. High-Level Design Overview
Architecture Diagram:
(See diagrams below)
Key Components:
Ingestion Layer: Automates data movement from tape to S3 using heuristics.
Iceberg Catalog (Polaris): Central metadata/catalog service for all engines.
Storage Layer: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for cost-effective archival.
Query Engines: Spark, Snowflake, Trino, PyIceberg, etc.
Lifecycle Management: Tag-driven policies for archival and retention.
7. Key Considerations & Assumptions
Query engine selection (Spark, Snowflake, etc.) is pending further evaluation.
Schema evolution and partitioning must be supported for long-term data management.
Tag-based archival requires admin-driven tagging and policy enforcement.
UDW uses Nessie, but this solution will use Polaris.

Implementation Approaches
Approach 1: Managed Polaris Catalog (Recommended)
Use Polaris as the central Iceberg catalog (managed or open-source).
Integrate with S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for storage.
Build ingestion pipelines (e.g., Spark jobs) to move data from tape/legacy DBs to Iceberg tables.
Implement tag-based policies for archival using Polaris metadata.
Enable cross-engine access (Spark, Snowflake, Trino) via the shared catalog.
Pros:
Centralized management, strong interoperability, future-proof, supports schema evolution.
Cons:
Requires initial setup and integration work.
Approach 2: Open Source Polaris Catalog
Similar to above, but self-host the Polaris catalog.
More control, but higher operational overhead.
Approach 3: Hybrid (Polaris + UDW/Nessie for Specific Use Cases)
Use Polaris for new archival workloads.
Maintain UDW/Nessie for legacy or specific use cases.
Gradually migrate all workloads to Polaris.
